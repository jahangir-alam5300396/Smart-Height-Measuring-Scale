##  Abstract
We designed and implemented a **smart height measuring system** using:
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** for height measurement
- **Arduino UNO** for data processing
- **LCD (16x2)** for displaying results
- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module** for wireless data transfer
- **Mobile Android App** to record measurements

The system can measure heights from **2 cm to 13 ft** with high accuracy, and adds mobile app integration as an extra feature compared to existing market devices.
